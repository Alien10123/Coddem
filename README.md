# Coddem

### About Coddem

Coddem will be a freemium and open-source programming website where anybody will be able to learn to code. The courses will be made by the Coddem team as well as the community. The creators of courses can make money. Some courses will be free for everyone, while some will be only for paid members. Coddem has just started and will take a long time to finish.

### Tech Used

It will use Svelte Kit, Tailwind CSS, Firebase and Auth0. The courses will not be available in the source code in this repo. For languages outside the browser, a serverless container will be run in that language. More will be added to this section later.

### How To Run Coddem Locally

To run it locally first clone this repo, then install the npm packages using `npm install`, `pnpm install` or `yarn add`. Then you can just run it using `npm run dev` or the equivalent in the package manager you use. 

If you would like to contribute to Coddem then you can look at the CONTRIBUTING.md file in the root folder of this repo. The Coddem team also will post updates on the development of Coddem on [this blog](https://blog.coddem.com).
