# Introduction

The first thing that we would like to say is thank you for considering to contribute to Coddem. It means a lot.

Please follow these guidelines when contributing to this repo, as it makes it easier to write code, keep everything consistent and make sure that the community of contributors are kind and welcoming to newcomers.

### What we are looking for

We would love for you to contribute to Coddem, and there are plenty of things to do. You can do anything from writing tutorials on how to contribute to and use Coddem, or helping write documentation, like this file that you are reading right now, writing code or tests, spotting bugs and reporting them, or even just giving us new feature ideas. These contributions are all welcomed. If you need help with something or would like a feature to be added please, instead of creating an issue, create a new discussion in the discussions tab.

### Rules

We do have some rules for contributing. The most important and first one is to be kind and respectful. Don't harass, discriminate, or be mean to anyone. For more info on that look at our code of conduct (coming). Please also don't ask for help or add feature requests in the issues tab. Please create a discussion instead. If you add a bit of code to Coddem, it isn't required but it is great if you could write some tests using playwright for it. Also functions over classes, and make sure to format everything using `npm run format` before submitting code. Make sure to use Typescript too.

### First Contributors

If you don't know where to start, you could start by looking for basic errors or spelling mistakes in the documentation and fixing them or creating issues, or look for issues labelled as a good first issue. You could also look in the discussions tab and look for people who need help, and if you ever need help you can always create a discussion. Everyone is a beginner at first so don't be scared.

#### Submitting Code

To submit code first create a fork of the code. Do the changes in your fork. If you want to then push the code to this repo, then make sure to use `npm run format` and make sure your code fits in with the styles of everything else and then just create a pull request to merge your code to this repo. Note that you might need to pull from this repo first if anything has changed.

### Reporting Bugs

#### Security disclosures

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email security@coddem.com instead. Even if you are unsure if it is a security, still email us, as there is no harm in telling us.


#### Normal Bugs

To report a bug just create an issue, or if you are having problems getting something working on your computer create a discussion.

### How to suggest a feature or enhancement

To suggest something please create a discussion. You can also optionally include a roadmap or how it could be implemented.

Now you are reading to start contributing to Coddem. Thanks for reading all of this.
